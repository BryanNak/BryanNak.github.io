This program gives a very shallow, visual example of how Principle Component Analysis works and how it can be used to compress an image into a smaller size. This program *should* work with different images as long as the code is changed to the location of the new photo. Python libraries numpy, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and pyplot are used alongside the scikit-learn machine learning library to produce the results.
