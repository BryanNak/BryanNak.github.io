## One of many UI saviors
Writing in HTML and CSS is an experience that I personally do not enjoy whatsoever. I find it to be confusing and irritating at times because there have been **many** occasions when I could not get an element to be centered despite trying 10 different methods where all of them do nothing or make things worse. Learning how to build a website with positioning in CSS and messing around with dimensions and floats has been quite the journey for me, and although there are times when I achieve my goals, the satisfaction of doing so is never there.

Over the past week and a half I have experienced coding with Bootstrap 5, which I will say, as an overall, I had a much better experience coding with Bootstrap 5 compared to without. There are a few things that still bothered me, however, but fortunately not as much as trying to center an element with raw HTML and CSS.

## Zen Coding
The first time I used Bootstrap 5, I thought to myself, "Wow, this is horrible. I can't get anything to work" because I was so used to coding without a UI framework. I had to look up documentation for how to use the framework, and the whole time I just thought that I could do this with HTML and CSS the old-school way, but after some time, I had a change of heart. As I built the habit of using the framework, I felt a little more comfortable utilizing it to its full potential rather than cutting corners with CSS. Instead of resizing fonts and icons and other elements in a separate CSS through `color: white` and `font-size: 16px` attributes, the same can be done all in the HTML file with classes `text-white` and `fs-4`. At first, I could not see how a UI framework would help me anyway whatsoever, but after really taking advantage of it when rebuilding a small part of the <a href="https://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, I had an eye-opening experience.

## Rebuilding the Internet (kind of)
During my attempt at recreating the Internet Archive webpage, I didn't realize at the time how much of an easier time I was having coding compared to if I were to do everything the hard way. Creating a navbar was made a lot simpler by simply adding the class `navbar` to a nav tag. I no longer had to worry about spacing the elements in the navbar because I could just put them in an unordered list, and Bootstrap took care of the heavy lifting. I didn't have to worry about padding or margins or spacing every single element (for the most part) anymore because Bootstrap would do all of that behind the scenes when I invoked certain classes on different elements. My main gripe about UI frameworks is that it works well when it *does* work, but there are times when  I run into the same problem as when I use HTML and CSS: not being able to center elements. I'm not sure what it is, but I can **never** center things, even if my life depended on it. It would be unfair to say that this is a shortcoming of Bootstrap 5, however because this is more of a user issue.

## Is it worth it?
I think that using Bootstrap 5 was a definite step-up from raw HTML and CSS because the amount of time cut from worrying about the specifics was incredible, and UI frameworks don't seem to have that high of a learning curve. Sure, at the beginning it may seem pointless, but after you experience how seamless the HTML coding experience is with it, it'll be hard to turn back.
